## 🎉 Fixes Applied - Your Earthquake Monitor Should Work Now!

### ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

1. **JavaScript File Reference** 
   - Fixed `github-script.js` → `script.js` in HTML
   
2. **Data Loading Format**
   - Updated JavaScript to parse JSONL format (one JSON per line)
   - Added proper error handling for malformed data
   - Ensured magnitude and datetime fields are properly mapped

3. **GitHub Actions Permissions**
   - Added `contents: write` permission to workflow
   - Fixed checkout configuration with `fetch-depth: 0`
   - Updated git push command to specify `origin main`

### 🧪 **Testing Results:**
- ✅ Data format validation: 5/5 lines parsed successfully
- ✅ Sample data shows proper magnitude and location info
- ✅ Local server can serve files without errors

### 🌐 **Your Website Status:**

**Local Testing:** Your site is ready to test at `http://localhost:8003`

**GitHub Pages:** 
- All fixes have been pushed to GitHub
- GitHub Actions should now work with proper permissions
- The auto-update system will run every 6 hours

### 🔧 **What Was Wrong:**

1. **"Error loading data"** was caused by:
   - JavaScript expecting JSON array format `[{}, {}, {}]`
   - But your data.json is in JSONL format (one JSON per line)
   - Now fixed with proper JSONL parsing

2. **GitHub Actions 403 error** was caused by:
   - Missing `contents: write` permission
   - Now fixed with proper workflow permissions

### 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test Locally:** Visit `http://localhost:8003` to see the working site
2. **Wait for GitHub Pages:** Your live site should update automatically
3. **Check Actions:** Monitor the Actions tab for successful auto-updates

Your earthquake monitoring system should now display proper statistics instead of "Loading..." and "Error loading data"! 🌍
